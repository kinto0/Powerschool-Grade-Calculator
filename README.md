# getGrade
This is a chrome extension that obtains your GPA on PowerSchool shows it on the website. It uses "content scripts" to inject getGrade.js and jquery onto the powerschool website, and that script parses through your grades and calculates the average.

Thank you to cale_b on stackoverflow for getting me rolling on the initial getGrade.js
