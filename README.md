# getGrade
This is a chrome extension that will eventually get your powerschool grade and print them on the website. It uses "content scripts" to inject getGrade.js and jquery onto the powerschool website, and that script parses through your grades and calculates the average.

Thank you to cale_b on stackoverflow for most of the getGrade.js
